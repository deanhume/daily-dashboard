This is a simple web app for home use that displays the train times and todays weather for a given location. It is currently customised to the UK but could be extended anywhere.

# APIs

This web app wouldn't be possible without the following services:

- UK Nationail Rail API via [Huxley](https://huxley.unop.uk/)
- [OpenWeatherMap.org API](https://openweathermap.org/)
